      summary: Request Access Tokens
      description: |
        This endpoint allows requesting an access token following one of the flows below:
        - Authorization Code (exchange code for access token)
        - Client Credentials (2-legged, there isnt resource owner information)
        - Resource Owner Password Credentials (2-legged, client provides resource owner name and password)
        - Refresh Token (exchange refresh token for a new access code)

        The table below indicates the required parameters for each specific grant_type options.
        Empty cells indicate a parameter is ignored for that specific grant type.

        Client authentication:
        - Confidential clients should authenticate using HTTP Basic Authentication. Alternatively, they may post
          their client_id and client_secret information as a formData parameter.
        - Public clients should send their client_id as formData parameter.
