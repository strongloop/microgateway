/**
 * Handle authorization requests from OAuth 2.0 clients.
 *
 * Obtaining authorization via OAuth 2.0 consists of a sequence of discrete
 * steps.  First, the client requests authorization from the user (in this case
 * using an authorization server as an intermediary).  The authorization server
 * conducts an approval dialog with the user to obtain permission.  After access
 * has been allowed, a grant is issued to the client which can be exchanged for
 * an access token.
 *
 * This middleware is used to initiate authorization transactions.  If a request
 * is parsed and validated, the following properties will be available on the
 * request:
 *
 *     req.oauth2.transactionID  an ID assigned to this transaction
 *     req.oauth2.client         client requesting the user's authorization
 *     req.oauth2.redirectURI    URL to redirect the user to after authorization
 *     req.oauth2.req            parameters from request made by the client
 *
 * The contents of `req.oauth2.req` depends on the grant type requested by the
 * the client.  The `server`'s request parsing functions are used to construct
 * this object, and the application can implement support for these types as
 * necessary, taking advantage of bundled grant middleware.
 *
 * Because the approval dialog may be conducted over a series of requests and
 * responses, a transaction is also stored in the session until a decision is
 * reached.  The application is responsible for verifying the user's identity
 * and prompting him or her to allow or deny the request (typically via an HTML
 * form).  At that point, `decision` middleware can be utilized to process the
 * user's decision and issue the grant to the client.
 *
 * Callbacks:
 *
 * This middleware requires a `validate` callback, for which the function
 * signature is as follows:
 *
 *     function(clientID, redirectURI, done) { ... }
 *
 * `clientID` is the client identifier and `redirectURI` is the redirect URI as
 * indicated by the client.  If the request is valid, `done` must be invoked
 * with the following signature:
 *
 *     done(err, client, redirectURI);
 *
 * `client` is the client instance which is making the request.  `redirectURI`
 * is the URL to which the user will be redirected after authorization is
 * obtained (which may be different, if the server is enforcing registration
 * requirements).  If an error occurs, `done` should be invoked with `err` set
 * in idomatic Node.js fashion.
 *
 * Alternate function signatures of the `validate` callback are available if
 * needed.  Consult the source code for a definitive reference.
 *
 *
 * Note that authorization may be obtained by the client directly from the user
 * without using an authorization server as an intermediary (for example, when
 * obtaining a grant in the form of the user's password credentials).  In these
 * cases, the client interacts only with the token endpoint without any need to
 * interact with the authorization endpoint.
 *
 * Options:
 *
 *     idLength    length of generated transaction IDs (default: 8)
 *     sessionKey  key under which transactions are stored in the session (default: 'authorize')
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 *     app.get('/dialog/authorize',
 *       login.ensureLoggedIn(),
 *       server.authorization(function(clientID, redirectURI, done) {
 *         Clients.findOne(clientID, function(err, client) {
 *           if (err) { return done(err); }
 *           if (!client) { return done(null, false); }
 *           return done(null, client, client.redirectURI);
 *         });
 *       }),
 *       function(req, res) {
 *         res.render('dialog', { transactionID: req.oauth2.transactionID,
 *                                user: req.user, client: req.oauth2.client });
 *       });
